    <p>Dear nephew,</p>

    <p>
        If you are reading this message, it means I have passed
        on. I left your cousins all my Lamborghinis and mansions, but you
        get my most prized possession: Hole in the Wall, the
        restaurant I never got to open. My dying wish is for you
        to get it going once and for all. I know you are no chef, so
        just learn one meal at a time. I recommend starting with
        burgers and fries. You are not likely to succeed, but if
        anyone can do it, that person's gonna be you, my most responsible
        nephew!
    </p>

    <p>
        Love,
        Uncle Joe
    </p>
