            <p>Dear nephew,</p>

                <p>
                    If you are reading this message, it means I have passed
                    on. I left your cousins all my Lamborghinis and mansions, but you
                    get my most prized possession: Hole in the Wall, the
                    restaurant I never got to open. My dying wish is for you
                    to get it going once and for all. I know you are no chef, so
                    just learn one meal at a time. I recommend starting with
                    burgers and fries. You are not likely to succeed, but if
                    anyone can do it, that person's gonna be you, my most responsible
                    nephew!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Love,
                    Uncle Joe
                </p>
